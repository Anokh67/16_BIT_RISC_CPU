# 16-bit RISC CPU

##  Overview
This project is a fully functional **16-bit RISC CPU** designed and implemented in **Logisim Evolution**.  
The CPU is capable of executing a custom instruction set that includes arithmetic, logical, branching, and memory operations.  

The main objective of this project was to gain hands-on experience with **computer architecture** by designing a CPU completely from scratch — from datapath and control logic to instruction set definition and testing.  

## Features
- **16-bit datapath** supporting a custom RISC instruction set.  
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** for addition, subtraction, bitwise operations, and comparisons.  
- **Register file** with multiple general-purpose registers.  
- **Control unit** for instruction decoding and execution sequencing.  
- **Program Counter (PC)** and **branch/jump instructions** for program control flow.  
- **Memory interface** supporting load and store operations.  
- Fully testable in **Logisim Evolution**, with working example programs.  

## Tools & Technologies
- **Logisim Evolution** – schematic-level CPU design and simulation.  
- **Digital Logic Design** – combinational/sequential circuits, control signals, datapath design.  
- **Computer Architecture** – instruction set design, execution cycle, and memory organization.  

## What I Learned
- How to design a **custom instruction set architecture (ISA)** tailored for a 16-bit RISC CPU.  
- Building the **datapath** components (ALU, registers, PC, memory).  
- Creating a **control unit** that orchestrates CPU execution across multiple instruction types.  
- Debugging and validating a CPU using **test programs and simulation**.  
- Gained strong foundations in **modular hardware design, instruction execution cycles, and CPU architecture concepts**.
