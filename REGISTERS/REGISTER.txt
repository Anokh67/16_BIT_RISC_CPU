## 📦 CPU Registers Overview

Registers are important because they **temporarily store data and instructions** that the CPU is currently using.  
In this build, I have **6 registers**:

### 🗂️ **Data Registers**

These registers are used to store and manipulate data during execution:

1. **AccA**
2. **AccB**
3. **X_and_Y**

### 📍 **Program Counter (PC)**

> **Holds the address of the next instruction** the CPU will fetch from memory.

---

### 🧭 **Memory Address Register (MAR)**

> **Holds the address of the memory location in RAM** that the CPU wants to access for a specific task, such as reading or writing data.

---

### 🧠 **Instruction Register (IR)**

> **Holds the actual instruction** being executed by the CPU.
