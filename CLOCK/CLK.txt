Having a clock is very important to ensure all tasks are in sync. Although it may seem difficult to create, it is very straightforward.
I have included 4 different types of input
1. The clock input
2. Enable the clock
3. Manual tick
4. Stop

- Enable must always be on to allow the clock to cycle.
- Clock input must be 1 to start the clock cycle.
- The manual tick allows the user to check what happens after one cycle.
  - The enable does not have to be one during a manual tick
- Stop makes the cycles halt.
