In my ALU, I have created 8 simple operations. Two of them are arithmetic, and the other six are logic. 
1. ADD
2. SUB
3. NOT A
4. A AND B
5. A OR B
6. A XOR B
7. A NAND B
8. A NOR B

I have also created two different flags in the ALU
1. Carry/borrow
2. Zero

The carry/borrow flag comes from the adder and subtractor itself, respectively. The zero flag was made by using the output data and comparing it with the value 0; if it was the same, the flag would become 1.
