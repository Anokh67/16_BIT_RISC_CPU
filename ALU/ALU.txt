In my ALU, I have created six simple operations. Two of them are arithmetic, and the other six are logic. 
1. ADD
2. SUB
3. A AND B
4. A OR B
5. A NAND B
6. A NOR B

I have also created two different flags in the ALU
1. Carry/borrow
2. Zero
3. Negative



The carry/borrow flag comes from the adder and subtractor itself, respectively. The zero flag was made by using the output data and comparing it with the value 0; if it was the same, the flag would become 1. Negative flag is checked to see if the MSB is 1 or 0.
